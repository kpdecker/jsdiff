   *
   * Note that this is (deliberately) incorrectly typed as `any` to avoid users whose `lib` & `target` settings in tsconfig.json are older than es2022 getting type errors when they build about `Intl.Segmenter` not existing.
   * This is kind of ugly, since it makes the type declarations worse for users who genuinely use this feature, but seemed worth it to avoid the majority of the library's users (who probably do not use this particular option) getting confusing errors and being forced to change their `lib` to es2022 (even if their own code doesn't use any es2022 functions).
   *
   * By default, `diffWords` does not use an `Intl.Segmenter`, just some regexes for splitting text into words. This will tend to give worse results than `Intl.Segmenter` would, but ensures the results are consistent across environments; `Intl.Segmenter` behaviour is only loosely specced and the implementations in browsers could in principle change dramatically in future. If you want to use `diffWords` with an `Intl.Segmenter` but ensure it behaves the same whatever environment you run it in, use an `Intl.Segmenter` polyfill instead of the JavaScript engine's native `Intl.Segmenter` implementation.
   *
   * Using an `Intl.Segmenter` should allow better word-level diffing of non-English text than the default behaviour. For instance, `Intl.Segmenter`s can generally identify via built-in dictionaries which sequences of adjacent Chinese characters form words, allowing word-level diffing of Chinese. By specifying a language when instantiating the segmenter (e.g. `new Intl.Segmenter('sv', {granularity: 'word'})`) you can also support language-specific rules, like treating Swedish's colon separated contractions (like *k:a* for *kyrka*) as single words; by default this would be seen as two words separated by a colon.
